linux - full of files only - everthing is a file

#Inode
1file = 1inode
In traditional file systems (like ext3/ext4), the total number of inodes is fixed when the partition is formatted. 
An inode is a data structure on a filesystem that stores metadata about a file or directory—such as file size, permissions, ownership, and location on the disk.
inode bursting - a condition in Linux-based file systems where all available inodes (index nodes) are used up, preventing the creation of new files or directories, even if the disk has plenty of free storage space.
